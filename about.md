# More Demons
The **Extreme Demon** is the highest difficulty in Geometry Dash.  
But are **Tidal Wave** and **Acu** the same difficulty? I think not! 
Want to change that? This mod is here for you!

- The mod is based on the now-unmaintained **Grandpa Demon** mod, with improvements, additional features, and updated support.

## Features
- Up to **6 new demon difficulties** above Extreme Demon!
- Demon List integration!

*Additionally, the highest difficulties have their own backgrounds for the level page! (optional)*

## New Demon Difficulties
The difficulties of Extreme Demons are chosen based on their positions on the AREDL.

- **Top 500 Demons** - Brutal Demon
- **Top 250 Demons** - Vicious Demon
- **Top 150 Demons** - Twisted Demon
- **Top 75 Demons** - Diabolical Demon
- **Top 25 Demons** - Infernal Demon
- **Top 1 Demon** - Omega Demon *(optional)*
